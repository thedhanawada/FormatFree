# FormatFree

FormatFree is a simple HTML page that allows you to clean up pasted text and copied text styles using JavaScript.

## Usage

To use FormatFree, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Select the tab for the type of text you want to clean: "Clean Paste" for pasted text, or "Clean Style" for copied text styles.

3. Paste your text into the input field and click the "Clean" button.

4. The cleaned text will be displayed in the output field.

## How it works

FormatFree uses JavaScript to remove HTML tags from pasted text and inline styles from copied text. The cleaned text is displayed in a `pre` element on the page.

The page includes two tabs, one for cleaning pasted text and another for cleaning copied text styles. The tabs are implemented using CSS and JavaScript.

## Limitations

FormatFree only supports cleaning static text. If you need to clean dynamic text or text generated by a server, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.
