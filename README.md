# FormatFree

FormatFree is a simple web tool that allows you to clean up HTML tags from pasted text. The tool provides a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to paste in text, clean it up, and copy the resulting text to your clipboard.

## How to Use FormatFree

Using FormatFree is easy! Here's what you need to do:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the FormatFree webpage.
2. Scroll down to the "Paste your text below" section of the page.
3. Paste the text you want to clean up into the text box provided.
4. Click the "Clean" button to clean up the text.
5. The cleaned text will be displayed in the "Cleaned text" section below the text box.
6. Copy the cleaned text to your clipboard by selecting it and pressing "Ctrl+C" or "Command+C".

That's it! You can now paste the cleaned text into your document or application of choice.

## How FormatFree Works

FormatFree uses JavaScript to remove HTML tags from pasted text. When you click the "Clean" button, the JavaScript code looks for all instances of HTML tags in the input text and removes them. The cleaned text is then displayed in the output section of the page.
